## Description

This is a personal travel blog site made with Astro and Sanity CMS.

You can view the live demo of this project [--> Here <--](https://ggab13.github.io/adventure-time/).

## Built With

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=astro,tailwind,js,css,html)](https://skillicons.dev)

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
